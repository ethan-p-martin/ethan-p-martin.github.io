# Hey there! 

I'm Ethan (he/him) - currently, I'm a graduate student in the Master of Public Health and Master of Social Work dual-degree program at Case Western Reserve University.


My website is a great place to learn more about my projects, publications, and education. My email is the best way to contact me – I'm happy to collaborate with and assist other scholars across disciplines!

# Research Interests

Informed by my experiences with direct service provision in acute psychiatric care, my training and professional work have focused on study design and analysis, especially in health care services and the social sciences. I have a special interest in working with sexual and gender minority populations to address social determinants of health and environmental and policy-level drivers of health inequities. With respect to data analysis, I’m interested in developing and applying techniques in causal mediation analysis and methods for addressing missing data.
